Question 1: Find the maximum number in any of three variables.

Start

INPUT A
INPUT B
INPUT C

IF A>B 
  THEN A>C 
    IF TRUE 
      THEN Print A
    ELSE Print C
ELSE B>C
  IF TRUE
    THEN PRINT B
  ELSE Print C

END

Question 2: Take three variables as input and add them without using the + operator (Use your head for this)

Start

INPUT A
INPUT B
INPUT C

Multiply B and C by -1
Set sum to 0

Set sum to A - B
Set sum to sum - C

End

Question 3: Create a small calculator which only does ‘+’ or ‘-‘Operations. (Hint: Take three variable inputs with
one being used for the operator)

Start

Set sum to 0
Set Multiply to 1 

INPUT A
INPUT B
INPUT C

Enter Operator: + OR x
IF Operator == "+"
  THEN Set Sum to A+B+C
END

IF Operator == "x"
  THEN set multiply to AxBxC
END

END
